Eaters.py
=========

Eaters.py is a simple Python program that simulates evolution. The actual simulation is made up of two things, the units/eaters/animals/Flatlanders (red circles), and food units (green circles). The Flatlanders move around randomly eating everything they can, and bigger ones can eat more, thus, over time, the average radius of a Flatlander will increase. This makes use of Pygame.
