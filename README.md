Eaters
======

Eaters is a simple Python program that simulates evolution. The actual simulation is made up of two things, the organism units (red circles), and food units (green circles). The organisms move around randomly, eating everything they can, and bigger ones can eat more, thus, over time, their average radius will increase. Eaters uses Pygame for graphics.
